title: Reranking
---

Upstash Search combines semantic and full text search results
seamlessly by default. However, the returned documents can be
reranked using a state of the art model to further improve
the ordering and scoring among them.

You can opt-in to use reranking for the resulting documents as follows:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">
```python
scores = index.search(
    query="space opera",
    limit=2,
    reranking=True,
)
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```ts
const searchResults = await index.search({
  query: "space opera",
  limit: 2,
  reranking: true,
});
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>
