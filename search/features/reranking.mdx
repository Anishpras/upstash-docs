title: Reranking
---

Upstash Search combines semantic and full text search results
seamlessly by default. However, the returned documents can be
reranked using a state of the art model to further improve
the ordering and scoring among them.

You can opt-in to use reranking for the resulting documents as follows:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">```python # Placeholder for Python example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">```ts // Placeholder for JavaScript example ```</Tab>

</Tabs>
