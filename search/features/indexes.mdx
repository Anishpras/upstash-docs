title: Indexes

Upstash Search allows you to partition a single collection into multiple isolated indexes.
Each index acts as a self-contained subset of the collection,
and search and upsert requests are limited to one index.

## Using an Index

Indexes are created implicitly when an upsert operation is performed,
so there is no specific endpoint for creating an index.

For example, the code snippet below will create the index `foo` if it does not already exist,
upsert and search the document only on that index.

## Deleting an Index
