## Data

Data is the indexed component of documents. It is an unstructured
text that is used both in semantic and full text search, after being
indexed behind the scenes.

It is mandatory to provide the data while upserting documents.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">```python # Placeholder for Python example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript">```ts // Placeholder for JavaScript example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="curl">```shell # Placeholder for curl example ```</Tab>

</Tabs>

Data is returned by default in search results. You can opt-out to retrieve
the data as follows:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">```python # Placeholder for Python example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript">```ts // Placeholder for JavaScript example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="curl">```shell # Placeholder for curl example ```</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Fields

Fields allow you to attach a context to your documents.
It is an optional JSON structured object, which does not
get indexed with the documents.

It has two main use cases:

1. As additional context for your application logic
2. As filtering input for search queries

You can upsert fields with your documents as follows:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">```python # Placeholder for Python example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript">```ts // Placeholder for JavaScript example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="curl">```shell # Placeholder for curl example ```</Tab>

</Tabs>

When you do a search, you can opt-in to retrieve the fields as follows:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">```python # Placeholder for Python example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript">```ts // Placeholder for JavaScript example ```</Tab>

<Tab title="curl">```shell # Placeholder for curl example ```</Tab>

</Tabs>
