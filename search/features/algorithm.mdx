Upstash Search blends semantic search with traditional exact keyword matching
to deliver results that are both accurate and relevant. By combining these
two approaches, it captures what users mean, not just what they type,
while still making sure exact keyword hits aren’t missed.

The system uses a hybrid setup that supports flexible “OR” logic for full-text search,
which pairs nicely with the semantic side. Together, they let Upstash Search:

- Understand the intent behind a query, even if the wording isn’t exact
- Find documents with related or alternative phrasing
- Work across all kinds of content and domains

Behind the scenes, user queries get a subtle boost from large language models,
helping the system better understand context and return smarter results
even when queries are vague or incomplete.
