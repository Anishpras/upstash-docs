`@upstash/search` is a TypeScript SDK for Upstash AI Search, enabling easier operations on Search Collections with full type coverage.

Using `@upstash/search` you can:

- Perform AI-powered search queries with or without reranking.
- Upsert documents with metadata to a collection.
- Fetch documents by their IDs.
- Delete documents from a collection.
- Access collection stats.
- Reset everything related to a collection.

You can find the GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/search-js). 

## Install

<CodeGroup>
```shell npm
npm install @upstash/search
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm add @upstash/search
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Initializing the client

There are two pieces of configuration required to use the Upstash search client: a REST token and REST URL. These values can be passed using environment variables or in code through a configuration object. Find your configuration values in [the console dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/search).

#### Using environment variables

The environment variables used to configure the client are the following. You can follow [this guide](/search/overall/getstarted) to retrieve credentials.

```bash
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL="your_rest_url"
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN="your_rest_token"
```

When these environment variables are set, the client constructor does not require any additional arguments.

```typescript
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";

const client = Search.fromEnv();
const index = client.index("movies")
```

#### Using a configuration object

If you prefer to pass configuration in code, the constructor accepts a config object containing the `url` and `token` values. This
could be useful if your application needs to interact with multiple databases, each with a different configuration.

```typescript
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";

const client = new Search({
  url: "<SEARCH_INDEX_REST_URL>",
  token: "<SEARCH_INDEX_REST_TOKEN>",
});

const index = client.index("movies")
```

#### Typescript

The Search SDK supports defining your content and metadata types at the index level for complete type-safety.

```typescript {4,5,6}
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";
const client = new Search();

type Content = { title: string, genre: string };
type Metadata = { year: number };
const index = client.index<Content, Metadata>("movies");

await index.upsert({
  id: "document-id",
  content: { title: "Star Wars", genre: "sci-fi" },
  metadata: { year: 1977 }
})
```

Passing a `Content` type at the index level will provide type safety for the content coming back from or required for the following commands:
- `search`
- `upsert`
- `fetch`
- `range`

In cases you don't want to define a content type at the index level, you can override the index level type definition for a specific command:

```typescript
const results = await index.upsert<Content>({
  id: "id",
  content: { title: "Movie title", ... }
});
```
