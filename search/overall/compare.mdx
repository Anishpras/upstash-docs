title: Compare

// there are a lot of competitors to compare us with:

- elastic
- meilisearch
- algolia

are the most popular SEO-wise. We could also go for "elasticsearch alternative", "meilisearch alternative" and "algolia alternative" on this page.

**The big question:** How do we want to compare ourself?

- result quality?
- speed / benchmarks?
- ease of use?

getting the framing here is important, comparing our v1 to a years-old search product might not be fair in terms of quality or speed.
