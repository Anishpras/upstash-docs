title: "Auth Provider Webhook"
---

This example demonstrates an authentication provider webhook process using Upstash Workflow. 
The workflow handles the user creation, trial management, email reminders and notifications.

## Use Case

Our workflow will:

1. Receive a webhook event from an authentication provider (e.g. Firebase, Auth0, Clerk etc.)
2. Create a new user in our database
3. Create a new user in Stripe
4. Start a trial in Stripe
5. Send a welcome email
6. Send a reminder email if the user hasn't solved any questions in the last 7 days
7. Send a trial warning email if the user hasn't upgraded 2 days before the trial ends
8. Send a trial ended email if the user hasn't upgraded

## Code Example

```typescript api/workflow/route.ts

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Sync User

We start by creating a new user in our database:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
const { userid } = await context.run("sync user", async () => {
  return await createUserInDatabase({ name, email });
});
```

```python Python
async def _sync_user() -> str:
    return await create_user_in_database(name, email)

result = await context.run("sync user", _sync_user)
userid = result["userid"]

```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Create New User in Stripe

Next, we create a new user in Stripe:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await context.run("create new user in stripe", async () => {
  await createNewUserInStripe(email);
});
```

```python Python
async def _create_new_user_in_stripe() -> None:
    await create_new_user_in_stripe(email)

await context.run("create new user in stripe", _create_new_user_in_stripe)

```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Start Trial in Stripe

We start a trial in Stripe:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await context.run("start trial in Stripe", async () => {
  await startTrialInStripe(email);
});
```

```python Python
async def _start_trial_in_stripe() -> None:
    await start_trial_in_stripe(email)

await context.run("start trial in Stripe", _start_trial_in_stripe)

```

</CodeGroup>

### 4. Send Welcome Email

We send a welcome email to the user:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await context.run("send welcome email", async () => {
  await sendEmail(
    email,
    "Welcome to our platform!, You have 14 days of free trial."
  );
});
```

```python Python
async def _send_welcome_email() -> None:
    await send_email(
        email, "Welcome to our platform!, You have 14 days of free trial."
    )

await context.run("send welcome email", _send_welcome_email)

```

</CodeGroup>

### 5. Send Reminder Email

After 7 days, we check if the user has solved any questions. If not, we send a reminder email:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await context.sleep("wait", 7 * 24 * 60 * 60);

const stats = await context.run("get user stats", async () => {
  return await getUserStats(userid);
});
await sendProblemSolvedEmail({context, email, stats});
```

```python Python
await context.sleep("wait", 7 * 24 * 60 * 60)

async def _get_user_stats() -> UserStats:
    return await get_user_stats(userid)

stats: UserStats = await context.run("get user stats", _get_user_stats)

await send_problem_solved_email(context, email, stats)

```

</CodeGroup>

The `sendProblemSolvedEmail` method:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
async function sendProblemSolvedEmail({
  context: WorkflowContext<UserCreatedPayload>
  email: string,
  stats: { totalProblemsSolved: number }
}) {
  if (stats.totalProblemsSolved === 0) {
    await context.run("send no answers email", async () => {
      await sendEmail(
        email,
        "Hey, you haven't solved any questions in the last 7 days..."
      );
    });
  } else {
    await context.run("send stats email", async () => {
      await sendEmail(
        email,
        `You have solved ${stats.totalProblemsSolved} problems in the last 7 days. Keep it up!`
      );
    });
  }
}
```

```python Python
async def send_problem_solved_email(
    context: AsyncWorkflowContext[UserCreatedPayload], email: str, stats: UserStats
) -> None:
    if stats["total_problems_solved"] == 0:

        async def _send_no_answers_email() -> None:
            await send_email(
                email, "Hey, you haven't solved any questions in the last 7 days..."
            )

        await context.run("send no answers email", _send_no_answers_email)
    else:

        async def _send_stats_email() -> None:
            await send_email(
                email,
                f"You have solved {stats['total_problems_solved']} problems in the last 7 days. Keep it up!",
            )

        await context.run("send stats email", _send_stats_email)

```

</CodeGroup>

### 6. Send Trial Warning Email

If the user hasn't upgraded 2 days before the trial ends, we send a trial warning email:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await context.sleep("wait for trial warning", 5 * 24 * 60 * 60);

const isUpgraded = await context.run("check upgraded plan", async () => {
  return await checkUpgradedPlan(email);
});

if (isUpgraded) return;

await context.run("send trial warning email", async () => {
  await sendEmail(
    email,
    "Your trial is about to end in 2 days. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform."
  );
});
```

```python Python
await context.sleep("wait for trial warning", 5 * 24 * 60 * 60)

async def _check_upgraded_plan() -> bool:
    return await check_upgraded_plan(email)

is_upgraded = await context.run("check upgraded plan", _check_upgraded_plan)

# end the workflow if upgraded
if is_upgraded:
    return

async def _send_trial_warning_email() -> None:
    await send_email(
        email,
        "Your trial is about to end in 2 days. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform.",
    )

await context.run("send trial warning email", _send_trial_warning_email)

```

</CodeGroup>

If they upgraded, we end the workflow by returning.

### 7. Send Trial Ended Email

If the user hasn't upgraded after the trial ends, we send a trial ended email:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await context.sleep("wait for trial end", 2 * 24 * 60 * 60);

await context.run("send trial end email", async () => {
  await sendEmail(
    email,
    "Your trial has ended. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform."
  );
});
```

```python Python
await context.sleep("wait for trial end", 2 * 24 * 60 * 60)

async def _send_trial_end_email() -> None:
    await send_email(
        email,
        "Your trial has ended. Please upgrade your plan to keep using our platform.",
    )

await context.run("send trial end email", _send_trial_end_email)

```

</CodeGroup>
