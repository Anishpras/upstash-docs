The **Agents API** of Upstash Workflow enables you to:  
- Execute an individual agent or facilitate collaboration among multiple agents.
- Integrate any tool compatible with AI SDK or LangChain.  
- Reliably invoke agents without concerns about timeouts or transient errors.
- Unlike mainstream agent frameworks, we prioritize debuggability and extensibility.

To get started, you can refer to the [Getting Started page](/workflow/agents/getting-started). For more details about the features, you can refer to [the Features page](/workflow/agents/features).

## Agent Patterns

If you're interested, you can also explore our rich examples that showcase how various patterns can be built using the Agents API:

    Sequential LLM calls where each output becomes the input for the next, enabling structured reasoning and step-by-step task completion.

  <Card title="Evaluator-optimizer" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/workflow/agents/patterns/evaluator-optimizer">
    A feedback loop where LLM outputs are evaluated and refined iteratively to improve accuracy and relevance.

  <Card title="Parallelization" icon="arrows-to-dot" href="/workflow/agents/patterns/parallelization">
    Distribute tasks across multiple LLMs and aggregate the results for efficient handling of complex or large-scale operations.
