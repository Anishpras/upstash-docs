`upstash/vector` is a PHP SDK for Upstash Vector, enabling easier operations on Vector Store.

Using `upstash/vector` you can:

- Upsert a vector with metadata to an index.
- Fetching the vectors with specified IDs.
- Querying a vector over pre-defined embeddings.
- Remove vectors from an index.
- Access index stats.
- Reset everything related to an index.

You can find the Github Repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/vector-php). 

## Install

```shell composer
composer require upstash/vector
```

## Usage

### Initializing the client

There are two pieces of configuration required to use the Upstash vector client: a REST token and REST URL. These values can be passed using environment variables or in code through the initialization of the Index. Find your configuration values in the console dashboard at [https://console.upstash.com/](https://console.upstash.com/).

#### Using environment variables

The environment variables used to configure the client are the following. You can follow [this guide](/vector/overall/getstarted) to retrieve credentials.

```bash
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="your_rest_url"
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="your_rest_token"
```

When these environment variables are set, you can initialize the client from the environment.

```php
use Upstash\Vector\Index;

$index = Index::fromEnv();
```

#### Manual Initialization

If you prefer to pass this values in code, the constructor accepts as parameters the `url` and `token` values. This
could be useful if your application needs to interact with multiple projects, each with a different configuration.

```php
use Upstash\Vector\Index;

$index = new Index(
  url: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL>",
  token: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN>",
);
```
