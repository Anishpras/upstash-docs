title: Getting Started with Laravel

`upstash/vector-laravel` is a dedicated Laravel SDK for Upstash Vector, that is built on top of our official PHP SDK.

By using `upstash/vector-laravel` you will be able to:

- Integrate Upstash Vector by only installing the package and setting environment variables.
- A native Vector facade to interact with your vector database.
- Able to maintain multiple index connections in your application.

You can find the Github Repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/vector-laravel). 

## Install

To install the SDK, you can use composer:

```shell composer
composer require upstash/vector-laravel
```

## Setup

There are two pieces of configuration required to use the Upstash vector client: a REST token and REST URL. These values can be passed using environment variables or in code through the initialization of the Index. Find your configuration values in the console dashboard at [https://console.upstash.com/](https://console.upstash.com/).

```bash
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="your_rest_url"
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="your_rest_token"
```

## Usage

Our Laravel SDK will configure your index into the Laravel Service Container. You can access it by calling the `Vector` facade
or by injecting the `IndexInterface` into your controllers.

### Vector Facade

When these environment variables are set, you can start using your Index by calling the `Vector` facade.

```php
use Upstash\Vector\Laravel\Facades\Vector;

Vector::getInfo(); // Fetches the index info.
```

### Dependency Injection

If you prefer to avoid using the facade, you can inject the `IndexInterface` into your controllers.

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Upstash\Vector\Contracts\IndexInterface;

class Controller
{
    public function index(IndexInterface $index)
    {
        $namespaces = $index->listNamespaces();
        
        return response()->json(['namespaces' => $namespaces]);
    }
}
```

## Configuration

You can also configure the SDK to be able to use multiple indexes in your application.

For doing that you can publish the configuration file by running the following command:
```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="vector-config"
```

You'll get a new file under `config/vector.php` that you can edit to add your indexes.

```php
return [
    'default' => env('UPSTASH_VECTOR_CONNECTION', 'default'),

    'connections' => [
        'default' => [
            'url' => env('UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL'),
            'token' => env('UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN'),
        ],
    ],
];
```

### Multiple Connections

If you want to use multiple connections in your application, you can add them to the `connections` array as shown below:

```php
return [
    'default' => env('UPSTASH_VECTOR_CONNECTION', 'default'),

    'connections' => [
        'default' => [
            'url' => env('UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL'),
            'token' => env('UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN'),
        ],
        'another' => [
            'url' => env('SECOND_UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL'),
            'token' => env('SECOND_UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN'),
        ],
    ],
];
```

To access a specific connection, you can use the `connection` method:

```php
use Upstash\Vector\Laravel\Facades\Vector;

Vector::connection('another')->getInfo();
```
