title: Deleting Vectors
---

You can easily delete vectors from our vector database, ensuring your data remains organized and up-to-date.

Our SDK allows you to delete vector data from indexes and/or namespaces.

## Delete

Every vector in our database has an ID defined by you. This ID is used to reference the vectors you want to delete.

We'll use the `delete()` method to instruct the SDK to delete vectors 1, 2, and 3, as shown below:

```php
use Upstash\Vector\Index;

$index = new Index(
  url: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL>",
  token: "<UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN>",
);

$index->delete(['1', '2', '3']);
// or within a namespace
$index->namespace('my-namespace')->delete(['1', '2', '3']);
```

You can read more about [Namespaces](/vector/features/namespaces) on our docs.
