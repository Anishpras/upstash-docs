title: What is Upstash Vector?
---

Upstash Vector is a **serverless vector database designed for high-performance vector search at scale**. It powers advanced systems in areas such as:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Recommendation engines
- Image recognition
- Clustering or classification

... without any infrastructure management.

## What is a Vector Database?

Vector databases are specifically designed to store and retrieve vectors, such as images, sounds, text, or other media. They allow for exceptionally efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, for example, through the use of approximation algorithms.

Vector stores are the perfect foundation on which to build similarity-based query capabilities, including search functionality. Because they're designed specifically for vector similarity search operations, they tend to offer higher indexing and query performance than general-purpose extensions like pgvector.

## Upstash Vector Core Features:

- **High-Performance Queries:** Upstash Vector is powered by DiskANN[1], a highly efficient approximation algorithm that delivers very high recall rates (resulting in better output quality) and ultra-low latency. See [ANN Search Algorithm](../features/algorithm) for more insight into the technology behind our vector database.

- **Batteries Included:** A convenient REST API and SDKs with first-class Python and TypeScript support.

- **Serverless Pricing:** Upstash Vector is fully managed and serverless, we take care of the hosting and high availability complexities. You only pay for what you actually use. See our [Vector Pricing Page](https://upstash.com/pricing/vector) for more details.

- **Multiple Similarity Functions:** We natively support similarity functions such as Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and dot product.
  See [Vector Similarity](../features/similarityfunctions) for more details.

- **Metadata Support:** Attach metadata to vectors to store additional information or context. When querying an index, you can then include a metadata filter to limit the search to records that match a filter expression. See [Metadata Documentation](../features/metadata) for more details.
