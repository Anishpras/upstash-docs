title: ERR max requests limit exceeded

### Symptom

The client gets an exception similar to:

```
ReplyError: ERR max requests limit exceeded. 
```

### Diagnosis

Your database exceeds the max monthly request count limit. 

### Solution-1

You can refactor your application to send less number of commands.

### Solution-2

You can upgrade your database to a paid plan, such as pay-as-you-go or a fixed plan 
by entering a payment method. When you entered your credit card, your database will be upgraded
automatically.
