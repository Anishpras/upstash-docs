You can use BullMQ and Bull with Upstash Redis. BullMQ is a Node.js queue library that is built on top of Bull. It is a Redis-based queue library so you can use Upstash Redis as its storage.

## Install

```bash
npm install bullmq upstash-redis
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

const myQueue = new Queue('foo', { connection: {
        host: "UPSTASH_REDIS_ENDPOINT",
        port: 6379,
        password: "UPSTASH_REDIS_PASSWORD",
        tls: {}
    }});

async function addJobs() {
    await myQueue.add('myJobName', { foo: 'bar' });
    await myQueue.add('myJobName', { qux: 'baz' });
}

await addJobs();
```

## Billing Optimization
BullMQ accesses Redis regularly, even when there is no queue activity. This can incur extra costs because Upstash charges per request on the Pay-As-You-Go plan. With the introduction of [our Fixed plans](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/pricing#all-plans-and-limits), **we recommend switching to a Fixed plan to avoid increased command count and high costs in BullMQ use cases.**
