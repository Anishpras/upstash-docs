We provide an open source Upstash MCP to use natural language to interact with your Upstash account, e.g.:

- "Create a new Redis database in us-east-1"
- "List my databases"
- "Show all keys starting with "user:" in my users-db"
- "Create a backup"
- "Show me the throughput spikes for the last 7 days"

## Quickstart

### Step 1: Get your API Key

1. Go to `Account > Management API > Create API key` and create an API key.
   <img src="/img/mcp/create-upstash-api-key.png" />
2. Note down your `<UPSTASH_EMAIL>` and `<UPSTASH_API_KEY>`.

### Step 2: Locate `mcp.json`

- **Cursor**: Navigate to `Cursor Settings > Features > MCP` and click `+ Add new global MCP server`. This will open the `mcp.json` file.
  <img src="/img/mcp/cursor-mcp-settings.png" />
- **Claude**: Navigate to `Settings > Developer` and click `Edit Config`. This will open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file. [Refer to the MCP documentation for more details](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).
- **Copilot**: Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace directory. For Copilot, first update the `mcp.json` file as described in the next step on this page, then follow the [Copilot documentation (starting from step 2)](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/extending-copilot-chat-with-mcp#configuring-mcp-servers-in-visual-studio-code) to configure MCP servers in VS Code Chat.

### Step 3: Configure the MCP File

There are two transport modes for MCP servers: `stdio` and `sse`. 

- **Stdio**: Best for local development. The server runs locally, and the client connects directly to it.
- **SSE**: Designed for server deployments. However, since clients don't yet support SSE connections with all the features we need, you need a proxy server. The proxy acts as a `stdio` server for the client and communicates with the SSE server in the background.

#### Option 1: Stdio Server

Add the following configuration to your MCP file:

<CodeGroup>
```json Claude & Cursor
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "upstash": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@upstash/mcp-server",
        "run",
        "<UPSTASH_EMAIL>",
        "<UPSTASH_API_KEY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```json Copilot
{
  "servers": {
    "upstash": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@upstash/mcp-server",
        "run",
        "<UPSTASH_EMAIL>",
        "<UPSTASH_API_KEY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Option 2: SSE Server with Proxy

SSE (Server-Sent Events) is the next stage in MCP transport modes after `stdio`. It is designed for server deployments and will eventually be followed by an HTTP-based transport mode. However, since clients currently do not support direct connections to SSE servers, we use a proxy to bridge the gap.

The proxy, powered by `supergateway`, acts as a `stdio` server locally while communicating with the SSE server in the background. This allows you to use the SSE server seamlessly with your client.

Add the following configuration to your `mcp.json` file:

<CodeGroup>
```json Claude & Cursor
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "upstash": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "supergateway",
        "--sse",
        "https://mcp-server.com/sse",
        "--oauth2Bearer",
        "<UPSTASH_EMAIL>:<UPSTASH_API_KEY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```json Copilot
{
  "servers": {
    "upstash": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "supergateway",
        "--sse",
        "https://mcp-server.com/sse",
        "--oauth2Bearer",
        "<UPSTASH_EMAIL>:<UPSTASH_API_KEY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Use MCP with Your Client

Once your MCP is configured, your client can now interact with the MCP server for tasks like:

- Seeding data
- Querying databases
- Creating new databases
- Managing backups
- Analyzing performance metrics

For example, you can ask your client to "add ten users to my Redis database" or "show me the throughput spikes for the last 7 days."
