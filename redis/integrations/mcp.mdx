We provide an open source Upstash MCP to use natural language to interact with your Upstash account, e.g.:

- "Create a new Redis database in us-east-1"
- "List my databases"
- "Show all keys starting with "user:" in my users-db"
- "Create a backup"
- "Show me the throughput spikes for the last 7 days"

## Quickstart

1. Go to `Cursor Settings > Features > MCP` and click `+ Add new global MCP server`. This opens a file called `mcp.json`.

2. Copy and paste the following command into the `mcp.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "upstash": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
           "@upstash/mcp-server",
           "run",
           "<UPSTASH_EMAIL>",
           "<UPSTASH_API_KEY>"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Replace `<UPSTASH_EMAIL>` with the email you use to login to Upstash
4. Replace `<UPSTASH_API_KEY>` with your account API key. Create one at `Account > Management API > Create API key`.

5. Cursor now recognizes the Upstash MCP server and all available tools ðŸŽ‰

To try it out, open the Cursor Agentic Chat. Cursor can now interact with our databases and will automatically use the MCP for Redis-related tasks like:

- Seeding data
- Querying databases
- Creating new databases
- Managing backups
- Analyzing performance metrics

For example, you can now ask Cursor to "add ten users to my Redis database".
